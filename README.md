IMPORTANTLY! There is a server (https://github.com/ars013/spring-boot-for-RAM). You have to clone it to your computer and run it. Without it, the application will not work. It also has a README.

This is a regular app that has a search box and a button. Type in the name of a character (e.g. Rick), click the button, and the app will show you a list of names and pictures of that character.

You just have to clone a Xcode project and open rick-and-morty.xcodeproj. Also you need the Xcode app, if you don't have it, download this app from the App Store. Select any iOS simulator and press the start button.

I chose something between MVVM and VIPER architectural pattern. The project has view controller, presenter, wireframe and network service. I tried to follow a clean architecture.

My technical stack and tools is Swift, UIKit, SnapKit, Java17, Maven (dependency manager), Spring Boot (Java framework to create backend services easily), IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, Postman (to test backend APIs before plugging into iOS).

I chose Swift because I know this language. Java17, Maven, IntelliJ IDEA, Postman and Spring Boot because it is convenient and fast to create a server with these tools.
